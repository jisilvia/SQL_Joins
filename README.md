# SQL Joins

The SQL Joins clause is used to combine records from two or more tables in a database. A JOIN is a means for combining fields from two tables by using values common to each.

## Project Description

This project uses the sakila sample database which contains customer- and inventory information for a movie rental business. Inner Join and Left Join statements are used to execute specific tasks such as creating email lists, checking inventory, and identifying movie genres.

## Requirements

**SQL.** Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language that is typically used in relational database or data stream management systems.

**SQL Client Software.** A software package designed to define, manipulate, retrieve and manage data in a database, such as:
- [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/)
- [MySQL Worbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/).

**Web Host Service.** A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service that allows individuals and organizations to make their website accessible via the World Wide Web.
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)

## Launch
Download the sakila database *sakila_data.sql* and schema *sakila_schema.sql*. Using your web host, create a new database for the downloaded files. Open the sakila schema file in your SQL client software and execute the code. Lastly, open the sakila data file in your SQL client software and execute the code to create the database.

Your SQL code is now ready to run.
